# framework
This is an "ultra-micro" framework for simple PHP applications. This was first created a couple of years ago to be used in a quick freelance project I worked on. Now, I use it to test other developers' coding and debugging skills.

## Usage
Create an `index.php` file to handle the requests and serve the responses. You can use the one located at `index.php.dist` as a starting point.

## Routing
You can use the `routing.php.dist` file to create simple routes.
